You are working inside my EXISTING React Native / Expo family app. The “Spin” tab has been refactored into a scalable “Games” hub using a games registry (e.g., src/games/registry.ts) with categories like “Spin Games” and “Party Games”, and Game Cards that navigate to game routes.

NOW implement the first Party Game: “Charades Mini” and wire it into the Games hub + registry. This is a SINGLE-DEVICE pass-and-play game (no multiplayer phones). Keep it simple, fast, and kid-friendly (ages 5, 6, 10).

NON-NEGOTIABLE UX RULES
- One device.
- Actor is trusted: after acting, the actor taps “✅ Guessed” or “❌ Skipped”.
- Fast flow: pass -> reveal (2s) -> act timer -> result -> next pass.
- Big font, big buttons, safe-area friendly (iPhone notch).

TASKS
1) Add the game to the registry
- Ensure registry contains an entry:
  id: 'charades-mini'
  title: 'Charades Mini'
  subtitle: 'Act it out. No talking.'
  category: 'party'
  icon: '🎭'
  routeName: 'CharadesMini'
  isNew: true
  isEnabled: true

2) Navigation
- Add a navigation route for CharadesMini:
  route name: 'CharadesMini'
  component: CharadesMiniScreen
- Tapping the Charades Mini card in Games hub should navigate correctly.

3) Implement CharadesMiniScreen (MVP)
Use a small reducer/state machine with useReducer.

STATE MODEL
Types:
- Player { id: string; name: string; }
- Settings {
    roundTimeSec: 20 | 30 | 45;   // default 30
    roundsPerPlayer: number;      // default 3
    category: 'all'|'animals'|'food'|'actions'|'objects'; // default 'all'
  }
- Turn {
    turnIndex: number;
    playerId: string;
    wordId: string;
    wordText: string;
    category: string;
    result: 'guessed'|'skipped'|null;
  }

Game State:
- status: 'SETUP' | 'PASS' | 'REVEAL' | 'ACT' | 'RESULT' | 'SUMMARY'
- players: Player[]
- settings: Settings
- turns: Turn[] (precomputed or built on the fly)
- currentTurnIndex: number
- usedWordIds: Set<string>

FLOW
A) SETUP
- Show title + “How to play” (very short).
- Player selection:
  - If the app already has participants/family members accessible, default to them.
  - Otherwise allow quick local player list:
    - show 3 rows by default (Player 1/2/3) editable names
    - “+ Add player”
    - Validate at least 1 player with non-empty name
- Settings controls:
  - Round time: segmented buttons 20/30/45 (default 30)
  - Rounds per player: stepper (1–5, default 3)
  - Category: pills (All/Animals/Food/Actions/Objects)
- “Start” button transitions to PASS

B) PASS
- Big text: “Pass to: <PlayerName>”
- Button: “I’m ready”
- On tap: choose a new word (no-repeat) -> go to REVEAL

C) REVEAL
- Show word in HUGE font
- Show “No talking” note
- Auto-hide after 2 seconds
- Then transition automatically to ACT

D) ACT
- Screen: “ACT NOW!” + large countdown timer (settings.roundTimeSec)
- Buttons: Pause/Resume, End Early
- When time ends or End Early -> go to RESULT

E) RESULT
- Show the word again (so the actor can confirm)
- Two big buttons:
  - “✅ Guessed” -> award point to the actor (current player)
  - “❌ Skipped”
- After selection:
  - Save result in the current turn
  - Advance currentTurnIndex
  - If more turns remain -> PASS with next player
  - Else -> SUMMARY

F) SUMMARY
- Show scoreboard table: Player | Points
- Buttons:
  - “Play again” (same players/settings, reshuffle words, reset scores)
  - “Change settings” (go back to SETUP)

SCORING
- Points are per player: +1 for each “guessed”.
- No negative points.

WORD BANK (NO API)
- Create src/games/charades/wordBank.ts
- At least 160 items total (40+ per category, “all” is combined).
- Format:
  type Word = { id: string; text: string; category: 'animals'|'food'|'actions'|'objects' };
- Words must be kid-friendly and easy to act.
- Avoid repeats within the same game session until bank exhausted. If exhausted, allow repeats but try to avoid immediate repeats.

WORD SELECTION
- Implement a pure function:
  selectNextWord({ category, usedWordIds, wordBank }) -> Word
- Category filtering:
  - 'all' uses the entire bank
  - otherwise filter by category
- If filtered list is empty (shouldn’t happen), fallback to all.
- If used list covers all available, reset used list for that category (or allow repeats).

UI / COMPONENTS
Create these components under src/games/charades/:
- CharadesMiniScreen.tsx
- SetupView.tsx
- PassView.tsx
- RevealView.tsx
- ActView.tsx
- ResultView.tsx
- SummaryView.tsx

Use existing app primitives (spacing, colors, typography, buttons) so it matches the app style.

ACCESSIBILITY / SAFETY
- Respect SafeAreaInsets
- Large touch targets
- Prevent accidental taps during REVEAL: disable buttons except maybe a “Hide now” (optional)
- Provide a small “Undo (3s)” after result selection (optional but nice). If you implement Undo, keep it very simple.

TESTS (LIGHTWEIGHT)
- Add unit tests for:
  - selectNextWord no-repeat behavior
  - reducer transitions for the main flow
Use Jest (project already uses Jest).

FINAL CHECKS
- Ensure the Games hub card opens Charades Mini.
- Ensure existing spin games are NOT changed or broken.
- App builds for iOS + Android.

When done, summarize:
- New files added
- How to add more charades words
- How to add a new game entry to the registry
