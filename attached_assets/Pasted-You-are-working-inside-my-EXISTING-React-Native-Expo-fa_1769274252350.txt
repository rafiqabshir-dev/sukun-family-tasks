You are working inside my EXISTING React Native / Expo family app. There is already a screen/page called “Spin” that currently contains TWO spin-based games (Assign a Task, and Family Game spin to earn points). I want you to REFACTOR and IMPROVE this screen so it becomes a scalable “Games Hub” where we can add more games later (including Charades Mini), without rewriting the screen each time.

PRIMARY GOAL
Turn the current “Spin” page into a generic “Games” page that:
- still supports the two existing spin games exactly as they work today
- looks cleaner and more intentional
- makes adding new games trivial (just add a config entry + screen)

HIGH-LEVEL UX
1) Rename the top title from “Spin” to “Games” (or keep route name Spin but show header title “Games”).
2) At the top, show a simple category switch:
   - “Spin Games”
   - “Party Games”
   - (future: “Learning”, “Rewards”, etc.)
3) Under the selected category, show a list/grid of “Game Cards”.
   Each card has:
   - icon/emoji
   - title
   - short subtitle (1 line)
   - optional “New” badge
   - on tap, navigates to that game screen

4) Keep the current two spin games under “Spin Games” category:
   - Assign a Task (existing experience)
   - Family Game (existing experience)

5) Add a placeholder/new entry under “Party Games”:
   - Charades Mini (we will implement the screen next; for now you can route to a stub screen that says “Coming soon” OR implement the basic Charades Mini screen if it’s already in scope)

ARCHITECTURE (IMPORTANT)
Create a “games registry” so we can add future games by configuration, not by editing UI logic everywhere.

- Create a file like: src/games/registry.ts
- Define a type:

type GameCategory = 'spin' | 'party';

type GameDefinition = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  category: GameCategory;
  icon: string;        // emoji is fine
  routeName: string;   // navigation route
  isNew?: boolean;
  isEnabled?: boolean; // future gating
};

- Export a constant array: GAMES: GameDefinition[] with at least:
  1) assign-task (spin) -> existing route/screen
  2) spin-race (spin) -> existing route/screen
  3) charades-mini (party) -> CharadesMiniScreen or stub route

SPIN-SPECIFIC DETAIL
The existing “Assign a Task” experience currently shows the wheel UI (as in the screenshot) and a big “Spin to Choose” button.
Do NOT break this. Keep it as-is. The Games hub should just route into it.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Keep the existing navigation route name (Spin) to avoid breaking tabs, but change internal UI to a Games hub.
2) Build a new screen component:
   - GamesHubScreen (or refactor SpinScreen into a hub)
3) Inside the hub:
   - Read GAMES registry
   - Filter by selected category
   - Render cards
   - Navigate to game route on tap
4) Keep the current look/feel (colors, spacing, rounded cards) consistent with the app.
5) Ensure safe area / notch spacing (the screenshot shows close-to-notch header).

ROUTING
- Ensure navigation has routes for the games:
  - Existing routes for the two spin games remain unchanged.
  - Add “CharadesMini” route:
    - If CharadesMiniScreen exists, route to it.
    - If not, create a simple stub screen “Charades Mini (Coming soon)” so the hub flow works.

QUALITY BAR
- No regressions on existing spin games.
- The hub should feel fast: minimal animations, big tap targets.
- Code should be clean and easy to extend.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated Spin tab screen to act as a Games hub
- New registry file with game definitions
- GameCard component (reusable)
- Category switch UI (simple segmented control or pill tabs)
- Navigation routes wired up for all game entries

After implementing, add a short developer note in comments:
“How to add a new game: add an entry to GAMES registry + add a route/screen.”

DO NOT ask me questions. Make reasonable assumptions and implement.
