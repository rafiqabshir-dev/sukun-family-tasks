You are working inside my EXISTING React Native / Expo family app that has a “Games” hub screen driven by a games registry (e.g., src/games/registry.ts). The hub shows categories (Spin Games, Party Games, etc.) and renders Game Cards from the registry.

TASK
Add placeholders for upcoming Learning games and show “Coming Soon” badges on those cards. These cards should be visible in the Games hub, but tapping them should open a simple “Coming Soon” screen that explains the game is not available yet.

WHAT TO ADD
1) Add a new category to the hub:
- “Learning Games”
(Internally can be category id: 'learning')

2) Add these new registry entries (all are placeholders):
- Dua Detective
- Seerah Stories
- Where In The World? (global geography)
- Somalia Explorer (Somalia-only geography/history)

Each should show:
- A “Coming Soon” badge on the Game Card
- Optional subtitle
- An icon/emoji
- isEnabled should be true (so it shows up), but mark as comingSoon

REGISTRY MODEL UPDATE
Update GameDefinition type to include:
- isComingSoon?: boolean
- comingSoonNote?: string (optional)

Example:
type GameCategory = 'spin' | 'party' | 'learning';

type GameDefinition = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  category: GameCategory;
  icon: string;        // emoji OK
  routeName: string;
  isNew?: boolean;
  isEnabled?: boolean;
  isComingSoon?: boolean;
  comingSoonNote?: string;
};

ADD THESE REGISTRY ENTRIES
Add these to GAMES array:

1) Dua Detective
{
  id: 'dua-detective',
  title: 'Dua Detective',
  subtitle: 'Match situations to du’as.',
  category: 'learning',
  icon: '🕌',
  routeName: 'ComingSoon',
  isNew: true,
  isEnabled: true,
  isComingSoon: true,
  comingSoonNote: 'Practice daily du’as with quick multiple-choice questions.'
}

2) Seerah Stories
{
  id: 'seerah-stories',
  title: 'Seerah Stories',
  subtitle: 'What happened next?',
  category: 'learning',
  icon: '📜',
  routeName: 'ComingSoon',
  isEnabled: true,
  isComingSoon: true,
  comingSoonNote: 'Short, kid-friendly Seerah questions with lessons.'
}

3) Where In The World?
{
  id: 'world-geography',
  title: 'Where In The World?',
  subtitle: 'Flags, countries, capitals.',
  category: 'learning',
  icon: '🌍',
  routeName: 'ComingSoon',
  isEnabled: true,
  isComingSoon: true,
  comingSoonNote: 'Fun geography quizzes: flags, continents, capitals.'
}

4) Somalia Explorer
{
  id: 'somalia-explorer',
  title: 'Somalia Explorer',
  subtitle: 'States, cities, and history.',
  category: 'learning',
  icon: '🇸🇴',
  routeName: 'ComingSoon',
  isEnabled: true,
  isComingSoon: true,
  comingSoonNote: 'Somalia-only quiz pack: states, cities, landmarks, basics.'
}

GAMES HUB UI CHANGES
3) Add category switch tab for “Learning Games” next to Spin Games / Party Games.
- Keep the UI consistent with existing segmented control / pill tabs.

4) Update GameCard to visually indicate “Coming Soon”:
- Show a small badge in the card header: “Coming Soon”
- When isComingSoon is true:
  - card still tappable
  - show a softer/disabled-ish style (slightly reduced opacity) but keep readable
  - show the badge clearly

COMING SOON SCREEN
5) Implement a reusable ComingSoon screen:
- Route name: 'ComingSoon'
- It should accept params from navigation:
  - title
  - description (comingSoonNote)
  - icon
- UI:
  - Big icon
  - Title
  - “Coming Soon” badge
  - 2–3 lines description
  - Button: “Back to Games”
- If params are missing, show generic message.

NAVIGATION WIRING
6) When tapping a Game Card that isComingSoon:
- Navigate to ComingSoon route with params:
  - title, description, icon
- For non-comingSoon games, navigate to their real route normally.

IMPORTANT
- Do NOT break existing Spin Games or Party Games.
- Charades Mini should remain playable and NOT show coming soon.
- Keep changes minimal, clean, and scalable.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated GameDefinition + registry entries
- Updated category switch to include Learning Games
- GameCard shows Coming Soon badge when applicable
- ComingSoon screen implemented and hooked up
- Tapping placeholder cards opens ComingSoon with correct title/description/icon
